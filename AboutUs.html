        <div class="paragraph">
            What is the humanity, what is the meaning of being part of this specie, well the answer is not clear yet. We just want to take in consideration what are the things that made harm to the human nature, and recognize wich ones benefit us in the fact of progress.<br>
        </div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            There are multiple kind of expressions of knowledge when we involve humanity, and every single one of them compose the trajectory of humanity. TRAJECTORY is what we are looking for, break the Cycle of limitations and get a reborn base in the nature as a specie, and reaching out the mark in the universe that we always have been looking for.

            <p class="paragraph">The Knowledge is the most powerfull tool humans have to change the path of their lives, a real impact helps people to understand and accept reallity, and with that information, decide if they'd preffer to live in that way for ever or change their state.</p>
            <h3 class="title">Prometheus and the light of knowledge</h3>
            <img src="Images/prometheus.jpg" alt="Prometheus" class="img">
            <P class="paragraph">Since we have the chance of think in our own existence, we understood that knowledge was something that we have to take from those who try to keep it for them self and control our nature, could be goods, polititians, companies, or even people that are experts in manipulation. All of them have something in common, and is that they understand they reallity and pretend to not share that with us, regular people who don't have more intentions than living a good live.<br><br>We are no special we are not smarter, we have no more chance thant the regular population all around. And even with those limitations, if we understand and accept our reallity, we can start to take points and make a real change in our lives</P>
